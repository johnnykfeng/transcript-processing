Large-Language models and machine learning research were the main topics of a presentation given by Karim Khayrat. The presentation discussed the use of large-language models in generating questions and the results of different experiments. Karim explained that the idea behind using large-language models is to improve the quality of generated questions. The presentation focused on a specific method called Guided by Bad Questions (GBQ), which aims to generate more complex and contextually aware questions. The GBQ method uses examples of bad questions from the MS Marco dataset and manually creates good questions. By using the full context of the document, the model generates both good and bad questions for each document.

Amir Feizpour asked about the source of the questions used in the GBQ method. Karim clarified that the bad questions were taken from the MS Marco dataset, while the good questions were manually created. Nikhil Varghese added that good questions tend to have longer format answers compared to bad questions, which often have single-word answers.

Another question raised by Amir was about the process of filtering the questions. Karim explained that in the GBQ method, the questions were filtered based on the mono T5 model instead of probability. This step was more expensive but resulted in higher quality filtering.

The presentation also discussed the results of experiments conducted using different models and datasets. Karim compared the performance of the mono T5 model trained on the MS Marco dataset alone, the MS Marco dataset plus InPart V1, and the updated version of InPart V2. The scores did not change significantly between the different versions, indicating that the quality of the questions remained consistent.

The presentation included a table showing the performance of the models on different datasets. The metrics used in the table were not fully explained, but it was clear that the mono T5 model fine-tuned on the MS Marco dataset performed well across the different datasets.

Amir asked for clarification on how to interpret the table. Karim explained that the table showed the performance of the models after retrieval with BM25 and fine-tuning with the MS Marco dataset. The metrics reported in the table were related to the top 10 results.

In conclusion, the presentation highlighted the use of large-language models in generating questions and the results of experiments conducted using different models and datasets. The GBQ method showed promise in improving the quality of generated questions, and the mono T5 model performed well across different datasets.

In another part of the presentation, Karim Khayrat discussed a paper on "Few-Shot Learning for Information Retrieval Tasks" and introduced the concept of self-instructs. The paper addresses the challenge of gathering expensive human data for training retrieval models. To overcome this, the authors propose a few-shot learning approach for generating synthetic training datasets.

The model overview involves providing a document and a prefix, which consists of N pairs of questions and relevant documents. The language model, such as GPT-3, is then used to generate a question that is relevant to the document. By setting N to three, thousands or even millions of training examples can be generated from a random document collection.

However, not all generated questions are of equal quality. To filter them, the authors select the top k examples based on the log probability of the generated output. In the paper, they filtered 100,000 examples and then further narrowed it down to the top 10,000.

Karim provides an example to illustrate the process. Given a document about the effects of caffeine during pregnancy, the language model is prompted to generate a question related to the document. The generated question is then paired with the document, and the top k pairs are selected based on their probability.

Amir Feizpour asks several questions during the presentation. He asks about the setup for the language model G and whether it produces multiple questions or just one. Karim explains that in principle, multiple questions can be generated, but the paper mentions generating only one question per document. The examples used in the prompt are dynamically sampled, and there is no retrieval happening at this point.

Amir also asks about the purpose of the re-ranker. Karim clarifies that the re-ranker is used to fine-tune the dataset. It takes the question and the document as input and scores their relevancy. The re-ranker is essentially a classifier that determines whether the question and document match or not.

Nikhil Varghese asks about the distinction between good and bad questions. Karim explains that in the prompt, they experimented with different methods, including having a good question and a bad question. A good question is relevant to the document, while a bad question is not. By prompting the language model with this distinction, they aim to generate higher quality questions.

Overall, the presentation provides insights into the few-shot learning approach for information retrieval tasks and the use of self-instructs to generate synthetic training datasets. The method shows promise in reducing the need for expensive human data and improving the quality of generated questions.

In another part of the presentation, Karim Khayrat discussed the topic of large-language models and machine learning research. He began by mentioning that the presentation would cover the generation of instruction following examples and the fine-tuning of the meta-model of the Metas Llama 7 billion model to create the Alpaca 7 billion model.

Karim then mentioned that the evaluation of the Alpaca 7 billion model was difficult to assess due to the lack of technical details in the blog post. However, he did mention that there was a web demo available. The claim made by the authors of the model was that it performed as well as the DaVinci 0.003 model. However, Karim expressed his skepticism based on his own experience. He mentioned that when he asked the model to recommend books on introductory food dynamics, it provided him with books that he would never read. In contrast, the Charge GPT model gave him recommendations that aligned with his academic background.

Karim acknowledged that the Alpaca 7 billion model might perform well in standard tasks such as writing a letter, summarizing a document, or generating questions from a document. However, he pointed out that there were still limitations due to the relatively small size of the model and its reliance on the original Llama 7 billion model. This means that the Alpaca model inherits the strengths and weaknesses of its predecessor.

Despite these limitations, Karim found the development of the Alpaca 7 billion model exciting. He highlighted that with a budget of $600, one could potentially create a model similar to Charge GPT by fine-tuning it on their own documents. He encouraged the audience to explore and experiment with the model.

Towards the end of the presentation, Karim mentioned that time was running out and asked if there were any questions. Amir Feizpour, one of the attendees, stated that he had no questions. The meeting concluded with thanks to Karim for his presentation, and the attendees were reminded to come back for the next session without specifying the paper they would be discussing.

In conclusion, Karim Khayrat's presentation provided insights into the Alpaca 7 billion model and its potential applications in machine learning research. He highlighted the limitations of the model while also acknowledging its exciting possibilities.

Large language models and machine learning research were the main topics of a presentation given by Karim Khayrat. The presentation focused on a specific paper called "Self-instruct" and discussed the goal of generating synthetic instruction datasets for various tasks.

The speaker explained that the previous paper they discussed involved generating questions based on a given document, which was a specific type of instruction. However, the goal of the "Self-instruct" paper was to generalize this process and generate prompts for any given task, making it more versatile.

The process started with a task pool consisting of 175 tasks, each with one instruction and one instance per task. For example, a task could be to sort a list of numbers in ascending order, with the instruction being the sorting process and the instance being the input and output. Some tasks didn't require an input, only an output, such as writing a letter according to specific instructions.

The task pool was then given to a language model, which went through two steps: instruction generation and instance generation. In the instruction generation step, the model was asked to generate instructions based on existing tasks. The prompt for this step was to come up with a series of tasks and their corresponding instructions. The model generated multiple instructions, and the process stopped after 16 tasks were generated.

In the instance generation step, the model was asked to generate both the input and output for the given instructions. The prompt for this step asked the model to come up with examples for the tasks and generate multiple examples if possible. The generated examples included tasks like exercises for reducing belly fat, converting Fahrenheit to Celsius, and sorting a list.

The generated instructions and instances were then used to create a dataset for fine-tuning a model. The speaker mentioned that the goal of this process was to fine-tune a model that could follow instructions given to it, similar to OpenAI's GPT model. The generated dataset was filtered to increase diversity and decrease overlap between similar tasks.

The speaker highlighted the advantages of this approach, including the ability to generate an unlimited amount of training data by using another model. They also mentioned a recent development called Alpaca, which introduced a 7 billion parameter model fine-tuned using the self-instruct process. This model was claimed to behave similarly to OpenAI's text DaVinci model while being smaller and cheaper to reproduce.

In conclusion, the presentation discussed the self-instruct process for generating synthetic instruction datasets and its potential applications in fine-tuning language models. The speaker also mentioned the
