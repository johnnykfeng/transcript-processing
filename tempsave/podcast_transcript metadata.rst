	The Pessimistic Fallacy 
		* The pessimistic fallacy is a cognitive bias that leads people to view scenarios, data, and predictions in a pessimistic light. 
		* People tend to believe that things were better in the past and that the current state of affairs is worse than it actually is. 
		* Hans Rosling's book, 'Factfulness,' provides a comprehensive exploration of this fallacy and its impact on our understanding of the world.
